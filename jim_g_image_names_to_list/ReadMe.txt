What is this?
This is a batch script that you can use by dropping an images folder onto it. The script will then extract all the file names and add them to a list.

This can be used with my other batch script, Jim-G-item_list_to_ox_items, to quickly generate items for your server.

How to use:
First, use jim_g_image_names_to_list by dropping your images folder onto the batch script.
Open the generated .txt file and verify that everything is correct.
Finally, drop the .txt file onto Jim-G-item_list_to_ox_items to generate the items.
